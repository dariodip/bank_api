# BankAPI

An API for a finctional bank backed by CQRS and Event Sourcing using [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) and [Commanded](https://github.com/commanded/commanded).

I've followed the tutorial from http://blog.nootch.net/post/event-sourcing-with-elixir/

## Getting started

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
